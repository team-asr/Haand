A Haptic &amp; Audio Augmented Navigation Device for the visually impaired
This is an archive project and has been uploaded here so that it can be of use to someone out there who is need of such a device.

What is it?
In 2014 we built a guide device for blind persons to navigate easily. It is an attachement to a white cane and has additional capability of being a
braille note taker, a calculator and otherwise a computer for blind individuals.
It costs about $200 in electronics and other parts and may offer an improvement to braille equipment in many places especially places with little budget
for these types of equipment. It is also a guidance and navigation device.
